# Metacircular-JS

![You complete me]('/assets/batman-joker.jpg)

A metacircular evaluator for Javascript, based on the SICP textbook. 

The metacircular evaluator is a story of two recursively mutual functions: `evaluate()` and `apply()`. They recursively evaluate an AST and apply the function using an underlying language runtime.
